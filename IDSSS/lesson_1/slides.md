# What is Python?


- Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was¬†initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

<br>
- What started as a hobby project, soon became a general purpose programming language: nowadays, you can use Python to build practically any piece of software. But how did this happen?

Here is another comment.

# Why is Python so popular?

- Well, first of all, Python is open source. It's free to use.

- Second, it's very easy to build packages in Python, which is code that you can share with other people to solve specific problems. Throughout time, more and more of these packages specifically built for data science have been developed. Suppose you want to make some fancy visualizations of your company's sales. There's a package for that. Or what about connecting to a database to analyze sensor measurements? There's also a package for that. People often refer to Python as the swiss army knife of programming languages as you can do almost anything with it.

# Arithmetic Operators 1

```python
## Multiplication
1 + 2 
```
```python
>>> 3
```

- In Python, we use the hash sign (`#`) to write comments.

- Everything written after a hash sign isn‚Äôt evaluated - it‚Äôs ignored.

- This method only works for one-line comments, though.

- We can also write multi-line comments.

üè† Can you find out how to write multi-line comments in Python?

# Arithmetic Operators 2


```python
## Subtraction
5 - 4 ## This is how we can subtract two numbers with Python
```
```python
>>> 1
```
<br>
```python
## Multiplication
2 * 5
```
```python
>>> 10
```
<br>
```python
## Division
10 / 2
```
```python
>>> 5
```

# Arithmetic Operators 3

```python
## Be careful when attempting to divide by zero!
10 / 0
```
<br>
```python
## "Modulo" operator

10 % 2 ## This operation gives us the remainder of a division

## What is the result of the operation "9 % 2"? 
```
```python
>>> 0
```
<br>
```python
## Exponents

print(9 ** 2) ## Introducing the "print()" function
print(9 ** 3)
```
```python
>>> 81
>>> 729
```
